 - subtract scrollbar from the canvas loader to avoid image jump
 - use portals for canvas loader instead
 - fix antialiasing issue (maybe it's mipmapping) (seems to be working now, find out why)
 - add dynamic imports when webpack fixes bug
 - add something build on Rust and WebAssembly in one of the cells
 - find a solution for restarting the loading animation when cells have canvases in them
 - infinite table effect
 - 3d stuff in cells
